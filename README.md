# STACK-IMPLEMENTAION
This is an implementaion of stack which is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of it as a stack of plates: you can only take the top plate off the stack.
